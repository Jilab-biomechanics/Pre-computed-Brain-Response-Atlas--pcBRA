We are sharing with the research community our pre-computed brain strain response atlas (Ji and Zhao, 2015; Zhao and Ji, 2015b) as well as the brain pressure response atlas (Zhao and Ji, 2016) for research use and evaluation, along with the associated analysis software. We are open to any constructive suggestions, recommendations, and comments to improve our work further.

#The pre-computed brain strain response atlas (pcBRA-strain):
The original pcBRA-strain encodes the peak maximum principal strain at every element, which requires an explicit definition of the element structure. To facilitate the exchange of data and results, the pcBRA-strain was spatially resampled to generate a set of 3D grid data points encoded with strain values, analogous to stacked medical images such as MRI or CT. This allows direct application of many existing visualization and analysis routines, without the need for element definition.

# The pre-computed brain pressure response atlas (pcBRA-pressure):
The three pre-computed pressure responses are shown below. They are linearly superimposed to obtain whole-brain pressure in an arbitrary translational head impact. Here is the data (right click to save, may need to rename to “.mat” extension) and demo program in Matlab.
