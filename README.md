## Prerequisites
- System: Windows/ MacOS/ Linux (e.g: Ubuntu 16.04)
- Matlab 2017 or above
- [Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Keras 2.2.4](http://faroit.com/keras-docs/2.2.4/#installation)
- [Tensorflow 1.11.0](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/1.11.0/#files)
## Data preprocessing:
- Resampling the impact profile to 1 ms (temporal resolution) 
- Acquiring Acceleration
- Scaling Acceleration
- Conjugate axis transform (if needed)
- Shifting based on resultant rotational velocity peak location
- Replicated padding
- Acquiring Acceleration
- Scaling Acceleration
- Combining velocity and scaled acceleration

## Preprocessing demo:
A data preprocessing demo is provided in /1__Preprocessing folder.
- Go to /Preprocessing
- Run `demo_preprocessing.m` in Matlab

## Pretrained CNN models:
Pretrained CNN neural network model is provided based on all of the brain response samples available in the published study (N=5661). They correspond to the maximum principal strain (MPS) pattern of the whole brain. 

## Strain Prediction demo:
To use the pretrained CNN models for strain estimation, please check the strain prediction evaluation demo in /2__Strain_prediction folder
- Go to /2__Strain_prediction
- Download [[pre-trained model]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iYKKr1NCk6FwGG1Ax-26Ueb-ipxfy8ih?usp=sharing) to "2__Strain_prediction"
- Run `python demo_evaluation.py`. 
- **Input**: Notice that this demo uses `Evaluation_example.mat` as an example rotational velocity and acceleration profile input for evaluation. 
- **Output**: The output file will be saved as `Output.mat` in the /2__Strain_prediction folder.

## Quick Run:
If you need to use your own rotational velocity input profile to estimate brain strains from the pretrained CNN models 
- Go to /2__Strain_prediction
- **Input**: Store your input as `pad_profile` (Check `demo_preprocessing.m` for detail) and save it as `Input.mat`
- Run `python predict_all.py`
- **Output**: The predicted outputs will be `predict_mps` (MPS of WB) saved in `Output.mat`. 
- You can easily modify the programs to batch process.

## Further development:
We would appreciate it if you can send us sample head impact kinematics data so that: (1) to verify that the CNN-estimated strains are sufficiently accurate relative to the directly simulated counterparts; and (2) to allow us expanding the training dataset to further improve the CNN estimation accuracy.
